# JustWatch-Web-scraping-
This repository contains my web scraping project focused on extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data from JustWatch. The goal was to scrape movie and TV show information from the JustWatch platform using BeautifulSoup, and Python, followed by data filtering and analysis with Pandas, and finally exporting the results to a CSV file.
